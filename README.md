<h4>Defining the Problem</h4>


<hr>

<h4>Our solution</h4>

<hr> 

<h4>Tech Stack</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Javascript</li>
    <li>Next.js</li>
    <li>React</li>
    <li>Supabase Authentication</li>
    <li>Supabase Database</li>
    <li>Figma</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h4>My Key Contributions</h4>
<ul>
        <li>Setting up the databases and authentication on Supabase and connecting it to the front-end</li> 
        <li>Keeping the team on track and focused on sprint goals</li>
        <li>Fixing bugs to ensure CI/CD</li>
</ul>

<h4>Challenges we faced</h4>
<p>We found Authentication difficult to implement and didn't build it into our app until the last week. The issue being we had already built the majority of the app to render on the client-side whereas Authentication ideally needs to happen on the server-side. We tried many different routes, tried and failed many times! Which made it particularly rewarding when we managed to resolve it in the final days.</p>

<hr>

<h4>What we would do differently</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Utilise the server-side rendering capabilities of Next.js more</li>
    <li>Gained a better understanding of client-side vs. server-side rendering</li>
    <li>Do more user testing throughout the project</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h4>What's next for Habitap</h4>

<p>We would like users to be able to select the plants they choose to grow, rather than a preset one. We would also like to tie the completion of users' plants to a charitable donation to the British Bee Charity. Another feature we would like to build is a team hive - social accountability was an important aspect of our app. We would look at users being able to join a group hive based on filtering and allow users to find other users who are looking to achieve similar goals, or being able to invite your contacts to your hive.
